# BMI Calculator

This is a simple **BMI (Body Mass Index)** calculator implemented in Java. The program takes the user's height (in centimeters) and weight (in kilograms) as input, calculates the BMI, and provides feedback based on the BMI value.

## How It Works

1. The program prompts the user to input their height in centimeters.
2. Then, the user is asked to input their weight in kilograms.
3. The BMI is calculated.

4. Based on the calculated BMI, the program will print a message to the user indicating their weight category:
   - **Underweight:** BMI < 18.5
   - **Normal weight:** 18.5 ≤ BMI ≤ 24.9
   - **Overweight:** 25 ≤ BMI ≤ 29.9
   - **Obese:** BMI ≥ 30

5. The user is then asked if they want to calculate the BMI again. If they answer "yes", the program will repeat. Otherwise, it will terminate.
